# Using a web server to serve JSON CCDT files on Red Hat OpenShift

This folder contains a sample ArgoCD application that can be used to deploy an Nginx web server to serve JSON CCDT files, alternatively you can just deploy the YAML samples in this order using **oc apply -f** :

ccdt-mq-routes-configmap.yaml  
ccdt-mq-services-configmap.yaml  
ccdt-server-deployment.yaml  
ccdt-service.yaml  
ccdt-route.yaml

Files explained,

ccdt-mq-routes-configmap.yaml  
cdt-mq-services-configmap.yaml

These files contain the CCDT information in JSON format, the Nginx deployment will mount them into the pod/container. You will need to edit these files to contain the services and routes for your cluster and MQ deployment. The MQ Routes used in the CCDT are created by the MQ Operator and can be used internally or externally but you must use the SNI approach in your MQ Client with these. The mq-services CCDT uses the Kubernetes Service to locate a queue manager and can be used with TLS or non-TLS client connections, the service can be used across namespaces if you include the full service URL.

ccdt-server-deployment.yaml

This file contains the Pod deployment for an Nginx web server that will host the CCDT files. The internal CCDT (mq-services) is located in the root of the file system, the external (mq-routes) CCDT is under /external. You can increase the number of Pods for high availability within your cluster. Note that the un-priviledged Nginx container image uses port 8080, previuosly is used port 80 by default.

ccdt-service.yaml

This file creates a Kubernetes Service and therfore an HTTP URL that will route to the Nginx Pods. e.g. "http://ccdt-service.mq-demo.svc.cluster.local:8080/ccdt.json" where mq-demo is the namespace that the web server has been deployed to.

ccdt-route.yaml

Creates an OpenShift Route that will allow lookups of the CCDT from outside or inside the cluster.

## Deployment overview

This diagram gives a high-level overview of the deployment and topology.
